# The LDPL Standard Library

This repository contains the LDPL Standard Library, which contains many
useful SUB-PROCEDURES for the
[LDPL Programming Language](https://github.com/lartu/ldpl).

The library is organized in a series of `.ldpl` files (*briefcases*),
each containing
SUB-PROCEDURES designed with a certain context in mind. For example the
`std-lists.ldpl` briefcase includes general LIST releated SUB-PROCEDURES,
like reversing a list or sorting its elements.

New SUB-PROCEDURES and entire briefcases are welcome contributions,
corrections and feedback are most certainly welcome as well.

## How to use the LDPL Standard Library

Just download the briefcase you want and IMPORT it in your LDPL source file.
For example, if you want to include the file `std-lists.ldpl` you must add
the line

`IMPORT "/route/to/std-lists.ldpl"`
